**About Me**

---
I received the B.S. degree in the School of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Ph.D degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2016 and 2022, respectively. I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.

My research interests include Machine Learning and Computer Vision:
- *Subspace Clustering*
- *Fine-Grained Visual Classification*
- *Zero-Shot/Few-Shot Learning*
- *Open-Set/Open-World Learning*
